# Roze-Photography
This project was created as part of my self-education and also as a gift for my girlfriend, who is a photographer. The website serves as her online portfolio, showcasing her photographic work, projects, and more.

Technologies
The project is built using the following technologies:
- Bootstrap 5 for quickly and easily creating a responsive and modern design without the need to write extensive custom CSS
- HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling
